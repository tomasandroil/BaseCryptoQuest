Explanation:
Connecting to Base Blockchain: We use the Web3 library to connect to the Base blockchain via an Infura node.
Smart Contract Interaction: The game interacts with a deployed smart contract (such as for minting NFTs). Youâ€™ll need to replace the placeholder values for the contract address and ABI with your own smart contract details.
Flask Web Interface: This creates simple routes like joining the game, collecting items, trading, and minting NFTs. You can extend this logic to include more complex game mechanics.
Features:
Join Game: Players can join the game using their blockchain address.
Collect Items: Players can collect items, which could be NFTs or other in-game assets.
Trade Items: Allows players to trade items with each other.
Mint NFT: Players can mint an NFT through the Base blockchain, with the transaction being processed using a smart contract.
